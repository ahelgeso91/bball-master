TO DO:
- play with weighted rolling averages

Profitability function
    - input: model, db, features, target
    - track profitability across models given the same inputs
    - output flat profits for each model
    - output db[pick, result, profits, odds, line, location, rolling efficiencies] for each model
    
New db:
    - create new database of this season
    - input year
    - output season's db up to today
    
update db function:
    - update current db based on current date
    - input: date, db
    - output: updated db
    - if end of season: end of season exception
    
    
AdaBoost and GradientBoost are the only ones with promise. Probably can combine them somehow to have more accurate picks or maybe figure out bet weights if they agree on a pick. Adaboost3 with gamma = 'auto' is mad aggressive but profitable due to high odds. ADA3 with gamma = 'scale' is very accurate and still sits around +190.
