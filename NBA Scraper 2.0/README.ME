Any notebook files are what I was using as I was playing around with the code and figuring out exactly how to structure everything.

The file "nba_scraper.py" is good to go. If you import nba_scraper and run nba_scraper.get_results(year), it will pull the results from that year including:
date
home team
home q1 score
home q2 score
home q3 score
home q4 score
home OT score
home total score
away team
away q1 score
away q2 score
away q3 score
away q4 score
away OT score
away total score
